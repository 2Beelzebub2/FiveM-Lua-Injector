A Free FiveM Lua injector, inspired by another free project that was unfortunately shut down.     
# How to use  
Turn off anti-virus, it will give false positive because of the new emulate program feature
Open the FiveM-Lua-Injector.exe **BEFORE** opening FiveM and inject the .lua you want.  
The injector comes with some features but for better experience I recommend using your own lua menu.
